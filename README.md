# Binary Counting Twiddler Layout
This is the layout I use for my [Twiddler 3](http://twiddler.tekgear.com/).

It's different in a few ways:

- I sacrifice chord count in favor of using only one column for most chords. I find it more comfortable.
- I don't rely on the thumb buttons for any chords.
- The alphabet counts up in binary. This makes it a lot easier for me to learn.

Check out the [csv](twiddler_cfg.csv) for more details.
